                <p class="date">October 2023</p>
                <p align="justify">College classrooms’ recorded CCTV videos were used as dataset. Two Models were
                    trained: 1. For detecting Cell-Phones and their Users 2. For detecting Tables. YOLOv8
                    (s, m, l) sizes were trained and YOLOv8m (55 epochs) gave the best results- 89.6%
                    mAP50. This model along with Table Detection Model were used to identify tables
                    where students used cell-phones and analyze their cell-phone usage.</p>
